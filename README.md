Solar system explore HTML canvas game
This is a project to make a game for middle school students to learn about the habitablility of objects in the solar system.
I am using the creation of this project to not only help my students learn remotely, COVID19 you know, but also
to learn more about javascript.  It as of today is only in vanilla javascript.
If the game is not intuitive enough, please let me know with a nice comment.
