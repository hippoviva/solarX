Solar system explore HTML canvas game
This is a project to make a game for middle school students to learn about the habitablility of objects in the solar system.
I am using the creation of this project to not only help my students learn remotely, but also
to learn more about javascript. It is only vanilla javascript and I have not used
classes so it will work on IE.
If the game is not intuitive enough, please let me know with a nice comment.
